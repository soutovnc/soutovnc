# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Vinicius de Souto, i'm a software engineer student.
I love to solve problems, participate in challenges or code marathons.

Enthusiast of technologies in the javascript world, I have studied and worked with other languages like **Python, C, Java, PHP**.
Currently focused on **Typescript, ReactJS, React Native and trying to master node.js**

I love to have fun when programming, solving challenges, practicing new concepts or giving life to some silly project.
